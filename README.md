This repository contains my week2 python assignments for AI/ML internship program. The tasks cover python fundamentals:

-Basic operations

-Lists and Numpy Arrays

-Dictonaries & Sets

Mini Project : prompt logger 

Python Fundamentals for AI/ML 

Task 1: Python Basics & Operators 
1. Create a Python script that accepts two numbers from the user. 
2. Perform all basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus, power). 
3. Demonstrate use of comparison and logical operators (>, <, ==, !=, and, or, not). 
4. Print results clearly using formatted output (f-strings).
   
Task 2: Lists and Arrays 
1. Create a list of 10 random integers. 
2. Perform the following operations: 
○ Add and remove elements. 
○ Find the maximum and minimum values. 
○ Sort the list.
4. Convert the list into a NumPy array and calculate: 
○ Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation.

Task 3: Dictionaries and Sets
1. Create a dictionary named student with keys: name, course, marks. 
2. Add a new key grade and assign a value based on marks (e.g., A/B/C). 
3. Print all keys and values using a loop. 
4. Create two sets of AI tools
   
Task 4: File Handling 
1. Create a text file named ai_students.txt. 
2. Write details of at least 5 students (name, marks, grade). 
3. Read the file and display students who scored above 75 marks.
   
Task 5: Real-World Mini Project
Create a Python program named ai_prompt_logger.py that: 
1. Accepts a user input (simulating an AI prompt). 
2. Saves the prompt text in a file named prompt_history.txt. 
3. Each time you run the program, new prompts are appended with timestamps.
